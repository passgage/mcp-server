PASSGAGE_BASE_URL=https://api.passgage.com

# Authentication Configuration - Choose your method:

# OPTION 1: Company API Key (Recommended for integrations)
# - Provides company-level access to all users and data
# - Long-lived authentication, no token refresh needed  
# - Best for system integrations and admin operations
PASSGAGE_API_KEY=your_company_api_key_here

# OPTION 2: User Credentials (For individual user access)
# - Provides user-level access with personal permissions
# - JWT token-based with automatic refresh
# - Best for personal use and user-specific operations
# PASSGAGE_USER_EMAIL=user@company.com
# PASSGAGE_USER_PASSWORD=user_password

# Advanced Configuration
PASSGAGE_TIMEOUT=30000                    # Request timeout in milliseconds
PASSGAGE_DEBUG=false                      # Enable debug logging
PASSGAGE_DEFAULT_AUTH_MODE=company        # Default mode: 'company' or 'user'

# Notes:
# - You can configure both API key and user credentials
# - Use authentication mode switching tools to change between them
# - Company mode: Full admin access, user mode: Limited personal access
# - If both are configured, DEFAULT_AUTH_MODE determines startup mode
