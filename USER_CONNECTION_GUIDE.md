## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Server URL
Contact your administrator for the global server URL:
```
https://passgage-global-mcp.your-company.workers.dev/mcp
```

### Step 2: Initial Claude Desktop Setup

      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "https://passgage-global-mcp.your-company.workers.dev/mcp",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Tools not found" or "Server not responding"

**Check 1: Config file syntax**
```bash
# Validate your JSON
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | jq .
```

**Check 2: Server URL**
Test the server directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server-url/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

**Check 3: Restart process**
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely (from system tray)
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Start Claude Desktop
4. Try a new conversation

### "Authentication required" errors

**Common causes:**
- Session expired (sessions last 8 hours)
- Missing X-Session-ID header in config
- Invalid credentials

**Solutions:**
1. Re-authenticate:
   ```
   Please login again with my Passgage credentials
   ```

2. Update config with new session ID

3. Check with your administrator if credentials changed

### "Rate limit exceeded" errors

**Cause:** Too many requests in short time (protection against abuse)

**Solution:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Reduce request frequency
- Contact admin if persistent

### Permission Errors

**"This operation requires company-level access"**

**Solutions:**
- Switch to company mode: `"Switch to company mode"`
- Contact HR/admin for company API key access
- Use user-specific alternatives

**"Cannot switch to company mode"**

**Cause:** No company API key configured

**Solution:** Contact your administrator to:
1. Get company API key
2. Create new session with both credentials:
   ```
   Please create a session with both my user credentials and company API key
   ```

## üìä Session Management

### Understanding Sessions
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for your connection
- **Expiry**: 8 hours of inactivity
- **Security**: Credentials encrypted in server storage
- **Isolation**: Your session is completely separate from others

### Session Commands
```bash
# Check session status
"Check my session status"

# List session info
"Show my session details"

# Switch between modes (if you have both credentials)
"Switch to company mode"
"Switch to user mode"
```

### Session Renewal
When your session expires:
1. You'll get authentication errors
2. Simply re-authenticate: `"Please login again"`  
3. Update your config with the new session ID
4. Restart Claude Desktop

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All credentials encrypted with AES-256
- **Isolation**: Complete separation between users
- **No logging**: Personal data never logged
- **Secure transport**: HTTPS-only communication

### What's Shared vs Private

**Shared (with server operator):**
- ‚ùå Request frequency and patterns
- ‚ùå Error rates and performance metrics
- ‚ùå Session creation/expiry events

**Private (never shared):**
- ‚úÖ Your Passgage credentials
- ‚úÖ Your workforce data
- ‚úÖ Specific request contents
- ‚úÖ Personal information

### Best Practices
1. **Strong passwords**: Use secure Passgage passwords
2. **Regular sessions**: Let sessions expire after work
3. **Shared computers**: Always logout on shared devices
4. **Monitor access**: Check session status regularly

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Workflow Automation
```bash
# Morning routine
"Check my pending approvals and today's schedule"

# Weekly reports
"Generate my team's attendance summary for this week"

# Bulk operations
"Process all pending leave requests with recommendations"
```

### Integration with Other Tools
```bash
# Export for Excel analysis
"Export overtime data to CSV for Q4 analysis"

```

### Custom Prompts
The server includes built-in prompts for common workflows:

```bash
# Onboarding workflow
"Help me with employee onboarding process"

# Troubleshooting
"I'm having issues with leave requests, please troubleshoot"

# API exploration  
"Show me what I can do with the Passgage API"
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Efficient Usage
- **Batch requests**: Ask for multiple items at once
- **Specific queries**: Be precise about date ranges and departments
- **Use filters**: Narrow down results with specific criteria

### Example Efficient Requests
```bash
# Instead of multiple requests
"Show me leave requests from John, Sarah, and Mike for this week"

# Instead of vague requests  
"List all sick leave requests from Engineering department submitted in December 2024"

# Use date ranges
"Generate attendance report for Sales team between Dec 1-15, 2024"
```

### Staying Organized
- **Regular cleanup**: Archive old leave requests
- **Consistent naming**: Use standard department/position names
- **Document changes**: Keep track of policy updates

### Common Questions

**Q: Can my colleagues see my requests?**
A: No! Each user has complete isolation. Even server administrators cannot see your workforce data.

**Q: What happens if the server goes down?**
